# Property Inspection Code Sample

Mobile Repair App Azure Active Directory Application Installation
=================================================================

The Android, Cordova, and Xamarin Repair Apps use O365 APIs and SharePoint REST APIs to interact with an O365 / Azure tenancy.  The Azure Active Directory Application is used to authorize the Android, Cordova, and Xamarin Repair Apps.  To register the Android, Cordova, and Xamarin Repair Apps with an Azure Active Directory see the [Mobile Repair App Azure Active Directory Application Installation README](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Property-Inspection-Code-Sample/blob/master/README-RepairAppAAD.md) for complete instructions.

Android Repair App
------------------

The mobile Repair App in the demo may also be run on Android in addition to the iOS version. The Android version of the Repair App is written in Java, the native language for an Android device.  

Some configuration is required to enable the Android Repair App to work with an O365 environment.  Read on to learn about the configuration process.

> This sample was tested with version 1.2.1.1 of Android Studio.

Android Repair App Installation
-------------------------------

Now you are ready to install the Android App.  

In the AndroidRepairApp folder you will find runnable sample code for Android Repair App.

1. On a PC or Mac machine, clone the GitHub repository.

6. Edit the **SHAREPOINT_URL** variable to match your O365 / Azure Tenancy by **replacing the TENANCY placeholder** with your tenancy name.  In the example below, the TENANCY placeholder was replaced with contoso.

	**SHAREPOINT_URL** is the URL for the Site Collection created by the Property Manager web app.  Use the same value you configured in the web.config for the Property Manager web app for the DemoSiteCollectionUrl app setting.

    Example: contoso.onmicrosoft.com

    Example: katiej@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
